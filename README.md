### What is Shredding <a name="explain"></a>

- File shredding, in simple terms, is the process of permanently and securely deleting a file from your computer or storage device in such a way that it cannot be easily recovered by anyone, even with specialized software or tools.

### What is Happening when Shredding <a name="hapening"></a>

- File shredding, on the other hand, goes beyond standard deletion. It involves overwriting the data of the file with random information or zeroes multiple times. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, for anyone to recover the original file's contents.

### Why Shredding is Important <a name="important"></a>

- File shredding is important for maintaining security and privacy. It ensures that sensitive or confidential information is permanently removed from your device and cannot be accessed by unauthorized individuals, even if they have access to advanced data recovery tools.

### When to use File Shredding <a name="whenuse"></a>

- File shredding is often used when you want to dispose of or sell a computer, external hard drive, or any storage device. It's also useful when dealing with sensitive documents, financial records, personal information, or any data that you want to ensure is completely gone
